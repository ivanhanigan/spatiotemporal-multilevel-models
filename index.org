* COMMENT Notes
** Update on reflections from Bob Haining's Lecture
[[http://ivanhanigan.github.io/2013/04/reflections-bob-haining/][Earlier this year]] Prof Bob Haining from the Geography Department Cambridge visited and gave us a great lecture on spatial regression.

This Tuesday at the [[http://gis-forum.github.io][GIS Forum]] we were lucky to be joined by statistician Phil Kokic from CSIRO who had heard we'd be discussing spatial autocorrelation (Phil is my PhD supervisor). Here are some quick notes I made:

*** CART Tree analysis that addresses the (potential)spatial autocorrelation problem
We started off the discussion with an assessment of the approach described in this post [[http://thebiobucket.blogspot.com.au/2012/03/classification-trees-allowing-for.html][Classification Trees and Spatial Autocorrelation]].

I've been thinking more and more about decision trees/CART/random forest methods for selecting a subset of relevant variables (and interations) for use in GLM or GAM model construction.  In a perfect world I'd have data on the main predictor I wanted to model and enough data about all the relevant other predictors (especially confounding or modifying variables) to ensure I get a 'well behaved model'. But with all the data around and so many potentially plausible relationships one might choose to include we need a way to narrow down these to just include the most important covariates, confounders and interactions.  CART or some variation on it seems a good way to do this, but is prone to the potential problem of spatially correlated errors too.

The idea from that blog post is:

"compute the classification tree, calculate residuals and use it for a Mantel-test and Mantel correlograms.
The Mantel correlograms test differrences in dissimilarities of
the residuals across several spatial distances and thus enable you to detect lag-distances where possible spatial autocorrelation vanishes.
...If encounter autocorrelation... try to use subsamples of the data avoiding resampling within the lag-distance.."

I think the workflow would be to

- fit the classification tree (Question: best to use all the data or with a sample like using cross-validation)
- get the residuals and visually assess the lagged distances plot provided by the Mantel correlogram.  Decide on a threshold (Question: is there an objective way to do this?).
- Sample from the data and select out from this sample only data from pairs with distances greater than the threshold (have to keep one out of each close pair or else we'd only be getting data from the sparsely sampled parts of our study region).

We all agreed this sounded OK, but only avoids the problem of spatial autocorrelation (and loses data).

*** Modeling with control for spatial autocorrelation
So we all agreed we'd prefer if our model can control for spatial autocorrelation.  I confessed that I'd always found the GeoBUGS tutorial and other tutorials about Bayesian methods for this very difficult and would really like a "Simple" way to make the problem go away.  So first we briefly reviewed Prof Hainings 3 equations again:

NOTE: THE FOLLOWING IDEAS WORK BEST FOR AREAL DATA.

*** The Spatial Error Model

$Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X_{1i} + \eta_{i}$

Where:

$\eta_{i}$ = Spatially autocorrelated errors.


*** The Spatial Lag Model

$Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X_{1i} + \rho(Neighbours Y_{ij}) + e_{i}$

Where:

$\rho_(Neighbours Y_{ij})$ = is an additional explanatory variable which is the value of the dependent variable in neighbouring areas. 

*** Spatially Lagged Independent Variable(s)

$Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X_{1i} + \beta_{2L} X_{2ij} + e_{i}$

Where:

$\beta_{2L} X_{2ij}$ = is the independent variable X2 that is spatially lagged.


*** Discussion
- Phil agreed with Bob that the spatial error model is the best, spatial lag model is OK and spatially lagged covariates not so great.
- For spatial error model fitting Phil suggested looking at R packages spBayes and spTimer
- I pointed out that I am mostly interested in "spatially structured time-series models" rather than spatial models at a single point in time.  By this I mean that we have several neighbouring areal units observed over a period of time.  In this framework the general methods of time series modelling are used to control for temporal autocorrelation.  However this makes the methods of spatial error and spatial lag models tricky because the spatial autocorrelation needs to be assessed at many points in time.
- I asked that if spatial lag is OK (and it seems easier to fit into the time-series model framework) how can I check to know if it has done the trick?  If this were purely a spatial model we could check for spatial autocorrelation in the residuals just as they described in the CART blog above, but here we have many maps we could make (one every time point), and our spatial autocorrelation measure would surely vary a lot over time.  SO would a simple way just be to asses the effect on the Standard Error on beta1 (our primary interest) and if it is bigger but still significant we can be reassured that our result isn't affected? Or perhaps we should assess the beta on the lagged variable, for instance is a significant p-value on the lagged Beta an indication that it is capturing the unmeasured spatial associations represented by the neighbourhood variable?  
- If it hadn't done the trick Nerida pointed out this might be because the Neighbourhoods are actually not appropriately represented by the first order neighbours and therefore more neighbours could be included, like moving out several concentric circles to wider and wider neighbourhoods
- Nasser and Phil pointed out that the lagged variable (the outcome in the neighbours) includes an element of the exposure variables, and said that it would be difficult to 'unpack' what that part of the model meant.
- so it looks like there is no simple answer and spatial error model is still preferred.

** Spatially Structured Timeseries Vs Spatiotemporal Modelling
In my last post about [[http://ivanhanigan.github.io/2013/09/reflections-bob-haining-update][spatiotemporal regression modelling]] I mentioned that I am mostly interested in "spatially structured time-series models" rather than spatial models at a single point in time. By this I mean that we have several neighbouring areal units observed over a period of time. In this framework the general methods of time series modelling are used to control for temporal autocorrelation. However this makes the methods of spatial error and spatial lag models tricky because the spatial autocorrelation needs to be assessed at many points in time.

I want to expand more on this topic because I want to be clear that the organisation of the material I am aiming to bring to this notebook topic is not aimed at purely spatial regression models [[https://geodacenter.asu.edu/spatial-lag-and][(there is a lot of material and tools out there already for that)]].  I am trying with these notes to document my learning steps toward integrating spatial methods with time-series methods to allow me to practice (and understand) spatiotemporal regression modelling.

*** Spatially Structured Time Series
In [[http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/08/08/1112965109.full.pdf+html][my most successful previous attempt to conduct a spatiotemporal analysis of Suicide and Droughts]] I built on my knowledge of time-series regression models from single-city air pollution studies where the whole city is the unit of analysis and the temporal variation is modelled with controlling techniques for temporal autocorrelation.  These techniques are also valid for multi-city studies because it is pretty safe to assume the cities are all independent at each time point.  I structured my study by Eleven large zones (Census Statistical Divisions) of NSW and assumed each of these would vary over time independent of each other, and I fitted a zone-specific time trend and cycle. This is what I call "spatially structured time-series" modelling.  

I justify using this model in this case because aggregating up to these very large regions will diminish the possibility of spatial autocorrelation and because Droughts vary over large spatial zones too, we will not suffer from exposure misclassificaiton bias.

So this model is a simple time-series regression (with trend and seasonality) and an additional term for spatial Zone.

\begin{eqnarray*}
        log({\color{red} O_{ijk}})  & = & s({\color{red}ExposureVariable})  + {\color{blue} OtherExplanators}  \\
        & &   + AgeGroup_{i} + Sex_{j} \\
        & &   + {\color{blue} SpatialZone_{k}}  \\
        & &  + sin(Time \times 2 \times \pi) + cos(Time \times 2 \times \pi) \\
        & &  + Trend \\
        & &   + offset({\color{blue} log(Pop_{ijk})})\\
\end{eqnarray*}

Where:\\

- ${\color{red}O_{ijk}}$ = Outcome (counts) by Age$_{i}$, Sex$_{j}$ and SpatialZone$_{k}$ \\
- {\color{red}ExposureVariable} = Data with {\color{red}Restrictive Intellectual Property~(IP)} \\
- {\color{blue}OtherExplanators} = Other {\color{blue}Less Restricted}  Explanatory variables \\
- s( ) = penalized regression splines \\
- ${\color{blue} SpatialZone_{k}}$  = {\color{blue} Less Restricted} data representing the $SpatialZone_{k}$  \\
- Trend = Longterm smooth trend(s) \\
- ${\color{blue}Pop_{ijk}}$ = interpolated Census populations, by time in each group\\

*** TODO Spatiotemporal modelling
In contrast to the above model for modelling exposures that have fine resolution spatial variation (such as air pollution) the exposure misclassification effect of aggregating up to very large spatial zones will conteract the benefits of avoiding spatially autocorrelated errors and this might be unacceptable for certain research questions.  Therefore it is important to move toward a spatiotemporal regression model that replaces the $SpatialZone_{k}$ term with a more spatial error or spatial lag approach.

<p>In my last post about <a href="http://ivanhanigan.github.io/2013/09/reflections-bob-haining-update">spatiotemporal regression modelling</a> I mentioned that I am mostly interested in "spatially structured time-series models" rather than spatial models at a single point in time. By this I mean that we have several neighbouring areal units observed over a period of time. In this framework the general methods of time series modelling are used to control for temporal autocorrelation. However this makes the methods of spatial error and spatial lag models tricky because the spatial autocorrelation needs to be assessed at many points in time.
</p>
<p>
I want to expand more on this topic because I want to be clear that the organisation of the material I am aiming to bring to this notebook topic is not aimed at purely spatial regression models <a href="https://geodacenter.asu.edu/spatial-lag-and">(there is a lot of material and tools out there already for that)</a>.  I am trying with these notes to document my learning steps toward integrating spatial methods with time-series methods to allow me to practice (and understand) spatiotemporal regression modelling.

  I will use the NMMAPSlite datasets for a simple example of what I
  describe as "Spatially Structured Timeseries" as opposed to
  "Spatio-Temporal" which I think more explicitly includes spatial
  structure in the model.  [See This Report](http://ivanhanigan.github.io/spatiotemporal-regression-models/) for all the gory details.

Package ‘NMMAPSlite’ was removed from the CRAN repository.
Formerly available versions can be obtained from the archive.
Archived on 2013-05-11 at the request of the maintainer.

The Archived versions do not seem to work either.

That is such a shame, lucky I saved some of the data using the following code:

*** Check Assumption of Proportional Hazards
#+begin_src R :session *R* :tangle NMMAPS-example/case-study-1-data-checking.r :exports reports :eval no
  # Checking the proportional hazards assumption for Indirect Age Standardisation
  
  # Background
  ## Indirect SMRs from different index/study populations are not strictly comparable
  ## because they are calculated using different weighting schemes that
  ## depend upon the age structures of the index/study populations
  ## (see http://www.statsdirect.com/webhelp/#rates/smr.htm).
  
  ## Indirect SMRs can be compared if you make the assumption that the
  ## ratio of rates between index and reference populations is constant;
  ## this is similar to the assumption of proportional hazards in Cox
  ## regression (Armitage and Berry, 1994).
  
  ## So we need to check if the rate ratio of the study population(s)
  ## compared to the standard population varies substantially with age.
  ## If not the proportional hazards assumption holds for the standard
  ## rates compared with the observed rates and the Indirect SMRs are
  ## comparable.  To do this check we calculate the Annualised Age Specific
  ## Rates for our study areas and for our standard for several years at
  ## periodic timepoints across the study period, and then calculate the
  ## ratio of these at each timepoint we could reassure our selves that
  ## this assumption holds.
  
  ## An additional issue arises when there are non-negligible differences
  ## in the age distributions of the study population(s) and the standard
  ## population. In this situation, indirect standardisation produces
  ## biased results due to residual confounding by age
  
  ## Also see Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. (2011). Principles on
  ## the use of direct age-standardisation in administrative data
  ## collections For measuring the gap between Indigenous and
  ## non-Indigenous Australians. Data linkage series. Cat. no. CSI 12.
