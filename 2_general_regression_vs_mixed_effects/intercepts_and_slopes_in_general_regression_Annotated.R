## this example comes from https://github.com/ivanhanigan/spatiotemporal-multilevel-models
## 2_general_regression_vs_mixed_effects/intercepts_and_slopes_in_general_regression_Annotated.R

#### load and clean in data ####

dat <- read.csv("data/simulated_data.csv")
dat$z <- factor(dat$z)

#### 1.2 exploratory work 

str(dat)
summary(dat)

#### subset the data to just including group 3 
# this was only dropped to make it simplier

dat <- dat[dat$z != "group3",]
str(dat)

# 1.3.1 remove features that don't contain any data 

table(dat$z)
dat$z <- factor(dat$z)
table(dat$z)

#### 1.2.1 plot for exploration 

plot(dat$x, dat$y)
plot(dat$z, dat$y)
plot(density(dat$y))
with(dat, plot(x, y, col = z))
legend("topleft", legend = 1:2, fill = 1:2)




#### 1.4 running a basic linear model ####


fit1 <- lm(y ~ x, data = dat)

summary(fit1)
## the results show that both the intercept and x are significant, and the R2 is 0.12

fit1cf <- coefficients(fit1)
fit1cf
# view the parameter estimates - intercept and slope (coefficient is slope)



#### 1.4.1 plotting basic linear model 

with(dat, plot(x, y, col = z))

abline(fit1cf[1], fit1cf[2])

## this is a wrong model! Because it's getting the middle and not capturing the difference in groups 

# 1.4.2 build a plot manually 

par(mar = c(3,3,2,1))
plot(1, type="n", xlim=c(-0.3,6), ylim=c(-1,0.5), xlab="", ylab="", axes = F)
axis(1, labels = F); axis(2, labels = F)
mtext("Y", 2, 1 , at = 0, las = 2)
mtext("X", 1, 1 , at = 3)
  
with(subset(dat, z == "group1"), points(x, y,  pch = 1, cex = .5))
with(subset(dat, z == "group2"), points(x, y, pch = 3, cex = .5))

# this plot can be bult into something awesome 

# the results suggest a a group level effect! So we can begin to build stratified model. 
# the intercept and slope can vary by group ie age / gender etc. 
# the effect of x on y is confounded by x. 


#### 1.5 a multiplicative interaction term (stratified model) ####

fit2  <- lm(y ~ (x * z), data = dat)

summary(fit2)

## what does the results mean? 

## x:zgroup2 - b3 - the term
# the difference of the slope between the two categories is significantly different. 
## following plot helps 

# so this model is a linear model however is times by the two groups (in my case that could be gender)
# results are much better - significant for all factors and R2 of 0.97

#### 1.5.1 plot the new model results ####
# wow very nice code to build this plot.  What is it telling me?
